//! Future Rust entry point for the Darkroom photo editor.
//!
//! Today the production binary is still the C-built `/usr/local/bin/darkroom`
//! launched by the autostart script. This binary (`darkroom-rs`) is grown in
//! parallel: each subsystem ported to Rust lands here and the C `main()` is
//! retired piece by piece. When the GTK4 shell, pipeline orchestrator, I/O
//! layer, and database glue are all in Rust, the install rule swaps over and
//! the C binary is deleted.
